# Low level lab

This repo is where I mess around with C, Rust, machine code, hardware designs,
etc. In particular, here are some things I've done in hre:

- Solutions for https://www.nand2tetris.org/
- Projects related to https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/
- General C, Rust, and assembly nonsense
- Operating Systems in Three Easy Pieces
  - https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/ (<https://ostep.org>)
- Code for https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-x64-Assembly-Programming-Professional/dp/1484250753

## TODO

nand2tetris C:
- Have assembler actually run and create integration tests
- Improve Makefile
- Consider https://github.com/antirez/sds for strings
